- 👋 Hi, I’m @astaylor92, a data-driven decision making enthusiast. Previously with Accenture Strategy, currently going deeper with math at Georgia Tech.
- 👀 I’m interested in anything that can be made better / faster / smarter with data. I'd write an LP to optimize my daily routine if I could. 
- 🌱 I’m currently a Master's of Analytics Student at Georgia Tech. Current courses are Discrete Optimization, Computational Data Analytics, and Data & Visual Analytics (specific, I know..)
- 💞️ I’m looking to work on any project that seems interesting! As someone who is not yet a parent but very into the Dad lifestyle, I'm eyeing some side projects that look into meal planning automation, smoker recipe exploration, beer popularity analysis, and digging into why the price of lumber is so high.
- 📫 Feel free to [connect with me](linkedin.com/in/andrew-taylor-6a77b932)
